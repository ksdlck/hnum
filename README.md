hnum
====

SYNOPSIS
--------

You get headers like this, with plain old CSS:

```
1 Chapter 1
1.1 Section 1
2 Chapter 2
2.1 Section 1
```

USAGE
-----

Download `hnum.css` or `hnum.min.css` to use in your project for the basic style described above. If you want to change the styling of the prefixes, change which section headings get numbers, add additional constraints on which headers are prefixed, etc., look at `BUILDING`.

BUILDING
--------

You will need [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus) to build `hnum`. Make your desired changes to `hnum.styl` and rebuild with `stylus`:

```
$ stylus hnum.styl
```
